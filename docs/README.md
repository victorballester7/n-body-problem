# Simulation of the n-body problem in 2 and 3 dimensions

Project that integrates the n-body problem in 2D or 3D. A web version of this project is still in progress.

The project is written in C and Python. The C code runs the rk78 integrator and the Python code is used to plot the results.

(Inspired by a project of https://github.com/daniellozanojarque)
